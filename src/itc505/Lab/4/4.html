    <h2>Description of Series</h2>
    <p>The Abraham Lincoln Papers are arranged in five series. All of the documents contained in Series 1-3 are reproduced online, as are the original materials contained in Series 4.</p>
<ul>
    <h3><li>Series 1, General Correspondence and Related Documents, 1833-1916</li></h3>
 <p>Consists of manuscripts inherited by Robert Todd Lincoln, which have been designated “The Robert Todd Lincoln Collection of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln.” Series 1 includes the so-called “Carpet Bag Documents,” 	which were stored in a carpet bag that suffered water damage. A list of the “Carpet Bag Documents” created in 1874 by Lincoln’s secretary John G. Nicolay is available in this series.</p>

<h3><li>Series 2, Additional Correspondence, 1858-1865</li></h3>
<p>Comprised of correspondence retained by Lincoln’s secretary John G. Nicolay, which remained with the Nicolay Papers (received by the Library in 1947) until August 1959, when the letters were removed and reincorporated with the Lincoln Papers.</p>

<h3><li>Series 3, Miscellaneous, 1837-1897</li></h3>
<p>Includes single or small numbers of manuscripts which have been acquired by the Library of Congress from a variety of sources.</p>

<h3><li>Series 4, Addenda, 1774-1948</li></h3>
<p>The addenda to the Abraham Lincoln Papers consists mostly of reproductions of government and military documents made from originals in the holdings of the National Archives and Records Administration, 1774-1887. Reproductions of documents held by the National Archives are not represented on this online collection, nor are published materials. Original items contained in Series 4 are included in this online collection and include letters written by Abraham Lincoln, an autobiographical sketch written in 1859 at the request of Jesse W. Fell, mourning cards, political ephemera, a pen purportedly used by Abraham Lincoln, and papers omitted as not being integral to the collection when it was microfilmed and indexed in 1960. Please consult the collection finding aid (PDF and HTML) for more detailed information about the contents of Series 4.</p>

<h2>Addendum:</h2>

<p><b>Background Image:</b> The background image applied to the entire page is of Abraham Lincoln. It adds a historical and thematic element to the website. The background-size: cover ensures that the image covers the entire viewport, and background-position: center center centers the image both vertically and horizontally. The background-attachment: fixed creates a parallax effect as the user scrolls.</p>

<p><b>Font Choices:</b>

Headers (h1 and h2): The font choices for h1 and h2 include 'Oswald' and 'Young Serif' for h1, and 'Open Sans' and 'Roboto Slab' for h2. These fonts have different characteristics, providing a visual contrast between the headings. 'Oswald' and 'Open Sans' are sans-serif fonts, while 'Young Serif' and 'Roboto Slab' are serif fonts. This contrast creates a visually appealing hierarchy.

Paragraphs (p): Three different fonts are applied to paragraphs for variety and visual interest: 'Akronim' (cursive), 'Almendra SC' (serif), and 'Pixelify Sans' (cursive). These fonts bring a unique look to the text, making it more engaging and artistic.

Heading Sizes: The choice of different fonts and sizes for h1 and h2 helps create a hierarchy in the content. h1 is styled with larger fonts to make it a prominent title, while h2 has slightly smaller fonts to denote subsections.</P>

<p><b>Color Choices:</b>

Text (body): The main text color is set to black (#000), ensuring good readability against the background image.

Header (header): The header has a white background (#fff) to create a visual separation from the content area.

Subsection Headings (h3): These are styled with a dark gray color (#333) to provide a clear distinction from the main text.

Paragraphs (p): The paragraph text color is also set to dark gray (#333) for consistency with subsection headings.</p>

<p><b>Margin and Padding Choices:</b> The stylesheet defines margin and padding for various elements. For example, the header has padding to create space around the header text. Margins are added to li elements to provide spacing between list items. Additionally, paragraphs have a margin of 10px on top and bottom to ensure they are well-spaced.</p>
