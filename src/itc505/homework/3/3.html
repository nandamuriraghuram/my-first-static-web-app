<h2> Font Resource </h2>

<p>To bring you the best in typographic diversity, we've sourced our fonts from Google Fonts, a rich library of typefaces that spans various styles, moods, and design preferences.

Google Fonts has enabled us to access a wide range of fonts that help us convey the right message with the perfect style. From elegant scripts to classic serifs and playful sans-serifs, we've harnessed the power of Google Fonts to enhance your visual experience.

Join us as we explore the world of fonts, one character at a time, all thanks to the incredible resources offered by Google Fonts.</p>


<h2>Font File Preparation: </h2>

  <p> - If you're using a web-safe font, Web-safe fonts are preinstalled on most devices and do not require font files to be hosted on your server.

   - If you're using a custom font, you'll need to obtain the font files (usually in formats like .woff, .woff2, .ttf, or .eot) and have them ready for hosting on your server.</p>


<h2>Apply the Font to Elements:</h2>

   <p>- After defining the `@font-face` rule, you can apply the custom font to specific HTML elements or globally to the entire document using CSS selectors like `font-family`.

   /* Apply the custom font to elements */

        body {

            font-family: 'Akronim';

        }
</p>

</body>
